# How to create official SCRD emails addresses

This process guide specifically describes how to create more emails with the `@steelcityrollerderby.org` domain on the end.

## Prerequisites

- You need to have access to the official Board of Directors email account (like, you need to be able to actually log into it and make changes)

If you do not have the above prerequisite, you will need to talk to someone on the board and get them to give you access or follow this guide themselves.

## Steps
1. Log into the official BOD email account (`bod@steelcityrollerderby.org`). This email account is the owning account of SCRD's GSuite which means that it has admin abilities.
2. Navigate to [the admin console](https://admin.google.com/ac/users) to list all of the users and add new ones.
3. Click the `Create User` button and follow the rest of the steps.
4. When you give the email to whoever needs it, be sure to tell them that they should **NOT** add a recovery email or a recovery phone because it's difficult to change and super hard to remove people when they are done with their position on the board or leave the league.
